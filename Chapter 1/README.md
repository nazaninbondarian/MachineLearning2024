## Project Tasks
### Question 1: Linear Classifier Evaluation and Training
1. **Diagrammatic Representation:** Train and evaluate a linear classifier. Provide a block diagram illustrating the process. Explain how to modify the block diagram for multi-class classification.
2. **Dataset Generation:** Use sklearn.datasets to generate a dataset with 1000 samples, 4 classes, and 3 features. Display and discuss the dataset's challenges.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use sklearn.linear_model to train a linear classifier. Detail the hyperparameter tuning process and results.
4. **Decision Boundaries:** Visualize decision boundaries and misclassified samples.
5. **Repetition:** Repeat the process with different feature sets and class numbers using drawdata.
### Question 2: Fault Detection Dataset
1. **Dataset Familiarization:** Investigate the CWRU Bearing dataset, identifying various features and states.
2. **Data Preparation:** Download and preprocess the normal and faulty data, creating a labeled matrix.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features using at least 8 methods listed in the project document. Form a new dataset.
4. **Data Shuffling:** Explain the importance of shuffling and split the data into training and evaluation sets.
5. **Data Normalization:** Normalize the data using at least two methods. Discuss the process and its importance.
6. **Model Training:** Train a classifier without using pre-built libraries. Evaluate the results and analyze the loss function.
### Question 3: Weather Data Analysis
1. **Dataset Analysis:** Analyze the Weather in Szeged dataset, focusing on the relationship between `Temperature` and `Humidity`.
2. **Model Implementation:** Implement RLS and LS models for temperature prediction. Compare the results.
3. **Weighted Least Squares:** Implement and explain the WLS method.
4. **Advanced Algorithm:** Research and implement the QR-Decomposition-Based RLS algorithm (optional).

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** Ensure Python is installed.
- **Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Google Colab:** For running and sharing notebooks.
- **GitHub:** For code versioning and sharing.
