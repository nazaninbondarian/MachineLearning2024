## Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Autoencoder Neural Networks
1. **Problem Analysis:** Identify the major challenges in developing models for fraud detection. Discuss the methods used in the paper to address these challenges.
2. **Network Architecture:** Provide a brief description of the network architecture used in the paper.
3. **Model Implementation:** Implement the autoencoder model, ensuring it is trained to avoid overfitting. Use validation error to restore the best model weights.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. Discuss the suitability of these metrics for imbalanced datasets.
5. **Threshold Analysis:** Analyze the effect of different thresholds on model performance and plot Recall & Accuracy graphs similar to figure 7 in the paper.
6. **Model Comparison:** Compare the results of the model trained on noisy and imbalanced data with the model trained on cleaned data.
