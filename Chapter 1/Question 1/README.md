## Question 1: Linear Classifier Evaluation and Training
1. **Diagrammatic Representation:** Train and evaluate a linear classifier. Provide a block diagram illustrating the process. Explain how to modify the block diagram for multi-class classification.
2. **Dataset Generation:** Use sklearn.datasets to generate a dataset with 1000 samples, 4 classes, and 3 features. Display and discuss the dataset's challenges.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use sklearn.linear_model to train a linear classifier. Detail the hyperparameter tuning process and results.
4. **Decision Boundaries:** Visualize decision boundaries and misclassified samples.
5. **Repetition:** Repeat the process with different feature sets and class numbers using drawdata.
### Q1A:
- Generate a Dataset with 1000 Samples, 4 Classes, and 3 Features.
- Use Two Linear Classifiers and Evaluate Them.
- Display Decision Boundaries and Regions.
### Q1B:
- Use drawdata Tool and Repeat the Process.
