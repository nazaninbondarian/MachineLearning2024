## Decision Tree Classification
1. **Dataset Analysis:** Choose a dataset related to drug classification or forest cover type. Split the data into training and test sets, and explain the method used for splitting.
2. **Decision Tree Implementation:** Implement a decision tree classifier. Evaluate its performance using confusion matrix and other relevant metrics. Visualize and analyze the results.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as pruning settings. Explain the impact of these changes on the model's performance.
4. **Advanced Methods:** Explore and implement advanced ensemble methods like Random Forests and AdaBoost to improve the model's performance.
