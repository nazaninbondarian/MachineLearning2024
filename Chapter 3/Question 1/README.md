# MachineLearning2024 - HomeWork 3 - Question 1
## SVM on Iris Dataset
1. **Dataset Exploration:** Load the Iris dataset and provide details such as mean, variance, number of samples, and dimensions. Perform dimensionality reduction (e.g., using t-SNE) and analyze whether it is useful for this dataset.
2.**SVM Implementation:** Use SVM with linear and kernel methods to classify the data. Visualize decision boundaries and confusion matrix. Explain the methods and reasons for choosing them.
3. **Kernel Comparison:** Experiment with different kernels (up to degree 10 for polynomial kernels) and compare the results. Create a GIF showing the decision boundaries for each kernel and degree.
4. **SVM from Scratch:** Implement the SVM algorithm without using pre-built libraries. Include methods for fitting, predicting, and using polynomial kernels. Compare the results with the scikit-learn implementation and provide a GIF of the decision boundaries.
