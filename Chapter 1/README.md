# MachineLearning2024 - HomeWork  1
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the "Machine Learning" course for the Spring 1403 at **Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology (KNTU)**. This project is designed to build upon the foundational skills from the first project and introduce more advanced topics in machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm implementation.

## Introduction
This repository includes the code, datasets, and reports for the second mini project. The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning. Detailed instructions and requirements for each part are provided below.
### Important Dates
- **Project 1 Submission Deadline:** 18:00, Friday, April 17, 1403
### Project Requirements
1. **Report:** A comprehensive textual report is required, covering all aspects of the project. This includes explanations and results for each section.
2. **Code Submission:** All code must be uploaded to both the university portal and GitHub.
3. **Structured Presentation:** The report should follow a structured format, with clear explanations for each question and section.
4. **Google Colab Integration:** Ensure your Colab notebooks are set to Public access and include all necessary outputs and code cells.

## Project Tasks
### Question 1: Neural Network Activation Functions
1. **Activation Function Analysis:** Assume a binary classification problem with a neural network that has two different activation functions (Sigmoid and ReLU) in the final layer. Analyze the implications.
2. **ReLU Replacement:** Provide an equation and explanation for a replacement of the ReLU activation function, detailing its benefits.
3. **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Design:** Design a simple neuron or perceptron that can distinguish the shaded triangular area from the rest in a given plot. Implement the network and visualize the results.
### Question 2: Fault Detection with Extended Dataset
1. **Dataset Extension:** Extend the previous mini project dataset by adding two more classes from the CWRU Bearing dataset. Analyze and provide a brief explanation of the faults related to each class.
2. **Feature Extraction and Data Preparation:** Implement the previous steps of data preparation and feature extraction on the new dataset. Add a validation set alongside training and test sets.
3. **MLP Model Training:** Train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
4. **Optimizer and Loss Function Comparison:** Compare the results using different optimizers and loss functions. Analyze the impact of these changes on the model's performance.
### Question 3: Decision Tree Classification
1. **Dataset Analysis:** Choose a dataset related to drug classification or forest cover type. Split the data into training and test sets, and explain the method used for splitting.
2. **Decision Tree Implementation:** Implement a decision tree classifier. Evaluate its performance using confusion matrix and other relevant metrics. Visualize and analyze the results.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as pruning settings. Explain the impact of these changes on the model's performance.
4. **Advanced Methods:** Explore and implement advanced ensemble methods like Random Forests and AdaBoost to improve the model's performance.
### Question 4: Heart Disease Dataset
1. **Dataset Analysis:** Use the Heart Disease dataset, split into training and test sets. Preprocess the data appropriately.
2. **Naive Bayes Classification:** Implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. Compare and analyze the results using both Micro and Macro averaging.
3. **Prediction Analysis:** Randomly select five data points from the test set, compare predicted outputs with actual values, and analyze the differences.
