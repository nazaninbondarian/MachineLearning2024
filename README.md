# MachineLearning2024
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the "Machine Learning" course for the Spring 1403 at **Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology (KNTU)**. This repository contains all the mini projects assigned throughout the course, each designed to enhance your understanding and skills in various aspects of machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm implementation.
## Introduction
This repository includes the code, datasets, and reports for the four mini projects. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, ranging from supervised learning and reinforcement learning to advanced neural network implementations. Detailed instructions and requirements for each project are provided in their respective sections.
