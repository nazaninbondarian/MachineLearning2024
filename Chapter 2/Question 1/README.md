## Question 1: Neural Network Activation Functions
1. **Activation Function Analysis:** Assume a binary classification problem with a neural network that has two different activation functions (Sigmoid and ReLU) in the final layer. Analyze the implications.
2. **ReLU Replacement:** Provide an equation and explanation for a replacement of the ReLU activation function, detailing its benefits.
3. **McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Design:** Design a simple neuron or perceptron that can distinguish the shaded triangular area from the rest in a given plot. Implement the network and visualize the results.
